# Loan Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes loan data to identify trends and patterns. It applies **data preprocessing and machine learning** techniques to understand loan approvals, defaults, and risk factors.

## Features
- Loads and processes real-world loan datasets.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Implements machine learning models to predict loan approval or risk.
- Includes data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Uses libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

You can modify parameters in the machine learning model and preprocessing steps to observe different outcomes.

The algorithms used included KNN Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, along with a comparison of their performance.
